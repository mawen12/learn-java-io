## NIO

Provide multiplexed I/O (a combination of nonblocking I/O and readiness selection) 
to facilitate the creation of highly scalable servers.

Lets client code initiate an I/O operation and subsequently notifies the client
when the operation is complete.
It can be used to facilitate the creation of highly scalable servers.
